		The hotel is in a good location - not far from Circular Quay, Opera House, Bridge and Darling Harbour. Shops are also close by. Room has everything you need - we paid a special rate due to construction, so we were pleased with what we paid for ($105 for the night). I&amp;apos;m not sure I&amp;apos;d pay the full price though. Rooms were clean with 2 large beds (maybe a bit smaller than a double bed per person).Car parking is a bit of a nightmare and is limited. The sign is small and entrance is round the corner from the hotel - once you&amp;apos;ve mastered the one way system (tip - if you are coming across Harbour Bridge, stay in a left hand lane).Costs $20 a night.Food and internet looked pricey - there are much cheaper options near by. Reception staff were fine and answered any questions.

		My husband and I recently stayed at the Le Pavillon for our anniversary. We happened to be in New Orleans for my birthday the weekend of Hurricane Katrina and had to evacuate on that Sunday with the rest of the city. It had been almost 2 years since we had returned to New Orleans. I wasn&amp;apos;t sure what to expect but the staff at Le Pavillon welcomed us back to a city that we love  had missed. We arrived by lunch time and we were given a room immediately. The walk to the French quarter was a nice stroll  felt safe. When we returned a complimentary bottle of champagne awaited us. We plan to stay at the Le Pavillon again in the near future.

		Very pleased with Magic Castle The Magic Castle TA reviews brought us here, and we were not disappointed. We stayed two nights in a first-floor 1-bedroom right off the pool. The hotel is a block from Hollywood Blvd, and just north of Grauman&amp;apos;s Theater. It is a landmark to locals and tours/deliveries all recognize it. Yes, the decor and fixtures are dated, but everything is clean and the service is exceptional. The continental breakfast, the location, whatever other &amp;apos;extras&amp;apos; you get, the security, free wireless (this review is going out on it), and the great service you receive merely underline what a great value this hotel is. The feeling was much more like a cozy BB than a hotel.The Magic Castle is a great value and would work well for families looking to stretch out a bit beyond the normal hotel room box.

		This hotel is aged and the rooms small. The staff is not helpful at all, although the man at the breakfast room (truly a continental breakfast, if you can even call it that and the food is lousy) was nice. Guests are not a priority here - I felt like they just wanted my money. The hotel staff, especially the front desk, is not attentive at all and border on rude. The rooms are dismal and feel like they haven&amp;apos;t been changed for 50 years, but not in a good way. You can do better.

		Booked a birthday weekend away for my other half at the Park Inn. First time in Berlin for us. Flew by Easijet and then took the Airport Express train to Alexanderplatz. The hotel was easy to spot being one of the tallest buildings around. Ok, Berlin is a building site at the moment but that is to be expected. The view from our room (23rd floor) was spectacular. We could see most of the historic landmarks. The room was clean and modern. The staff in the hotel were friendly, helpful and mostly local. This hotel is so central to all the historic sites. The TV tower is a must (just have lunch in the revolving restaurant). Most sites are witin walking distance. The Berliners were polite, friendly and accommodating. Even the young youths at the railway station (who were wearing hooded tops!) were most helpful in giving us directions!! I will definitely go back. Just make sure you go with someone you know well as the bathrooms are not particularly private with all that glass!! We had a 25 hr delay on the journey home but we met some fantastic people and turned it into a positive experience!!

		Spent 5 nights for business and pleasure at resort. Here are the goodparts. Nice pool, gardens and facility overall. Beach is long but in most places pretty thin. The resort seems to be on a point and it blocks most wave action near the beach which results in very still waters. Rooms were quite large and nice overall. The rooms are cabanastyle and pretty spread out on the facility. Expect to walk quite a bit. The hotel offers golf cart shuttle service for your bags and self but it can be spotty. Now for the bad. You are isolated. If you do not have a car, you are stuck with the hotel food service which is mediocre at best. It is pricey too boot. Check-in took me about 1/2 hour. Service is spotty and overall slow. (My room was always nicely made and cleaned each day however.) Forget about taking a cab to explore the area because they cannot promise you that you will get a cab to return (especially at night.) The hotel is about an houraway from Old San Juan. There are no nearby resturants. The rainforest is nearby however. There is a golf course (Coco Beach) nearby but expect to pay $10 shuttle service for a van to take you a 1/4 mile. The course is expensive which is typical for outsiders in PR and not well maintained. It has a pretty nice design but needs a lot of maintenance. Some bunkers had nice powdery sand, others had rock-filled dirt. Overall, there are better choices in San Juan area.

		There were roaches in the bathroom. The air conditioner in the hallways was almost non existant!! The sheets were so thin you could actually see through them. they should shut it down!!!

		great location. lovely lobby. nice staff. then to the room. It was just a standard room but in a 4* hotel it should have been better. The decor was stark. The carpet was very stained with goodness know what. the pillows were like bricks. I had to remake the bed the bedding was all crumpled. At least you had some english tv channels. Breakfast was not included, but at the price even a continental would have been nice. There is a very nice take away sandwich shop near by. I was dissapointed.
